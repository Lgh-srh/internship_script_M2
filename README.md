# README


In this folder, you will find the various scripts used during my internship at the Alpine Ecology Laboratory, listed in the order of their usage.

## 1) R_studio_script_dataWork_LinearModel.md

This first script involves performing an exploratory analysis using the linear model applied to our datasets (cf. C:/internship_script_M2/Repository_private).


## 2) R_studio_script_dataWork_FilteringSteps.md

This second script revisits certain parts of the previous code, but this time applies filters to clean our datasets and includes additional analyses.

## 3)Bash_script_depth&consensus.md

Here, we aim to retrieve the raw coverage data to assign it to a figure in the following script, as well as to retrieve the consensus sequences for editing (cf. paper).

## 4)R_studio_script_dataWork_PlotWithCoverage.md

Script for creating the graph by position, applying the raw coverage data (see paper).
